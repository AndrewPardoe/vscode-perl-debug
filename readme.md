### Credits

Credits goes to for making an awesome editor and a nice getting started mock debugger: [https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug.git](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mock-debug.git)

### Disclaimer

I'm in no way a perl expert - if you find bugs in the vs / perl debugger integration or want to contribute with code please don't hesitate.



Kind regards

Morten
